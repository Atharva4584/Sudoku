# Sudoku Solver
# Overview
I have developed a desktop application, Sudoku Game which consists of a solver function based on the backtracking algorithm. The idea of building the game tested the skills of data structures and algorithms. The naive backtracking algorithm was optimized using the visited vectors. Learned the usage of the Tkinter library in python for creating a graphical user interface.
